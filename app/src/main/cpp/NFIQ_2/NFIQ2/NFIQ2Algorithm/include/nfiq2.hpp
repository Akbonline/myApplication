/**
 * @mainpage
 * @section Overview
 * NIST Fingerprint Image Quality (NFIQ) 2 is open source software that links
 * image quality of optical and ink 500 PPI fingerprints to operational
 * recognition performance. This allows quality values to be tightly defined and
 * then numerically calibrated, which in turn allows for the standardization
 * needed to support a worldwide deployment of fingerprint sensors with
 * universally interpretable image qualities. NFIQ 2 quality features are
 * formally standardized as part of [ISO/IEC 29794-4][1] and serve as the
 * reference implementation of the standard.
 *
 * @section api Application Programming Interface
 * This webpage details the application programming interface (API) for NFIQ 2.
 * If you are not a software developer and only need to compute NFIQ 2 quality
 * scores for 500 PPI optical or ink fingerprint images, please navigate to the
 * [releases page][2] and download a pre-compiled version of our example
 * application.
 *
 * @section quick_score Quick Start
 * Follow these high-level steps to compute an NFIQ 2 quality score in your own
 * application.
 *
 *   1. Include `nfiq2.hpp` in your source file.
 *      - NIST's [releases][2] install headers in `/usr/local/nfiq2/include` on
 *        macOS and Linux, `C:\Program Files\NFIQ 2\include` on Windows 64-bit,
 *        and `C:\Program Files (x86)\NFIQ 2\include` on Windows 32-bit.
 *   2. Instantiate a NFIQ2::ModelInfo that points to the included
 *      [random forest model parameters][3], and use it to instantiate a
 *      NFIQ2::Algorithm.
 *   3. Instantiate a NFIQ2::FingerprintImageData with a *decompressed*
 *      fingerprint image.
 *   4. Pass the NFIQ2::FingerprintImageData from 3 to
 *      NFIQ2::Algorithm::computeQualityScore of the NFIQ2::Algorithm
 *      instantiated in 2. A quality score is returned or a NFIQ2::Exception is
 *      thrown.
 *      * **Note**: If the calling application needs to inspect individual
 *                  quality feature values or quality module calculation speeds,
 *                  first call NFIQ2::QualityFeatures::computeQualityModules or
 *                  NFIQ2::QualityFeatures::computeQualityFeatures with the
 *                  image from 2 instead, and then pass the result of that
 *                  method to NFIQ2::Algorithm::computeQualityScore. Use the
 *                  other methods within NFIQ2::QualityFeatures to isolate the
 *                  individual quality feature values and quality module speeds
 *                  required.
 *
 * @section Examples
 * Some examples of using the API can be found in the [examples directory][4] in
 * the NFIQ 2 repository.
 *
 * @section Contact
 * If you found a bug and can provide steps to reliably reproduce it, or if you
 * have a feature request, please [open an issue on GitHub][5]. Other questions
 * may be addressed to the project maintainers by emailing nfiq2@nist.gov.
