/**
 * @brief
 * A Watchdog object can be used by applications to limit the amount of
 * processing time taken by a block of code.
 */

/**
 * @details
 * A Watchdog object is used to set a timer that, upon expiration, will
 * force a jump to a location within the process. An application can
 * detect whether the timer expired at that point in the code. Watchdog
 * builds on the POSIX setitimer(2) call. Timer intervals are in terms
 * of process virtual time or real time, based on how the object is
 * constructed.
 *
 * Most applications will not directly invoke the methods of the WatchDog
 * class, instead using the BEGIN_WATCHDOG_BLOCK() and END_WATCHDOG_BLOCK()
 * macros. Applications should not install their own signal handlers, but
 * use the SignalManager class instead.
 *
 * The BEGIN_WATCHDOG_BLOCK() macro sets up the jump block and tells the
 * Watchdog object to start handling the alarm signal. Applications must call
 * setInterval() before invoking the BEGIN_WATCHDOG_BLOCK() macro. 
 *
 * The END_WATCHDOG_BLOCK() macro disables the watchdog timer, but doesn't
 * affect the assigned interval value. Applications can set the interval once
 * and use the block macros repeatedly. Failure to call setInterval()
 * results in an effectively disabled timer, as does setting the interval to 0.
 *
 * The ABORT_WATCHDOG() macro also disables the watchdog timer but does not
 * create the code point destination for the jump point. This macro should
 * be used to disable a Watchdog object when the application is no longer
 * interested in the timeout condition.
 *
 * @attention
 * The BEGIN_WATCHDOG_BLOCK() macro must be paired with either the
 * END_WATCHDOG_BLOCK() macro or ABORT_WATCHDOG_BLOCK() macro. Failure
 * to do so may result in undefined behavior as a running Watchdog timer
 * may expire, forcing a jump into an incompletely initialized function.
 *
 * @note
 * Process virtual timing may not be available on all systems. In
 * those cases, an application compilation error will occur because
 * PROCESSTIME will not be defined.
 *
 * @attention
 * On many systems, the sleep(3) call is implemented using alarm
 * signals, the same technique used by the Watchdog class. Therefore,
 * applications should not call sleep(3) inside the Watchdog block; behavior
 * is undefined in that case, but usually results in cancellation of the
 * Watchdog timer.
 *
 * @attention
 * The setCanSigJump(), clearCanSigJump(), setExpired() and clearExpired()
 * methods are not meant to be used directly by applications, which should
 * use the BEGIN_WATCHDOG_BLOCK()/END_WATCHDOG_BLOCK() macro pair.
