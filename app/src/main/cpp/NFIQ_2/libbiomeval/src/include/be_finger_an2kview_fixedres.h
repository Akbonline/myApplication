		 * A base Finger::AN2KView object represents an ANSI/NIST
		 * Type-3/4/5/6 record, and can return the image as well
		 * as the other information associated with that image, such
		 * as the minutiae from the corresponding Type-9 record.
		 *
		 * For these types of records, the image resolution and
		 * scan resolution are identical. For compressed images,
		 * applications can compare the image resolution and size
		 * taken from the Type-3/4/5/6 record to that returned by
		 * the Image object directly.
