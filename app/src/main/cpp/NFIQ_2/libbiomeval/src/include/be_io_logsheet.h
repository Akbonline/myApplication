		 * @brief
		 * A class to represent a logging mechanism.
		 *
		 * @details
		 * A Logsheet is an output stream, so applications can write
		 * into the stream as a staging area using the << operator, then
		 * start a new entry by calling newEntry(). Entries in the log
		 * are prefixed with an entry number, which is incremented
		 * when the entry is written (either by directly calling
		 * write(), or calling newEntry()).
		 *
		 * How the log data is stored is implemented by subclasses
		 * of Logsheet.
		 *
		 * @note
	 	 * By default, the entries in the Logsheet may not be
		 * immediately written to the backing store, depending on the
		 * buffering behavior of the operating system. Applications
		 * can force a write by invoking sync(), or force a write at
		 * every new log entry by invoking setAutoSync(true).
		 * @note
		 * Entries created by applications may be composed of more than
		 * one line (each separated by the newline character). The text
		 * at the beginning of a line should not "look like" an entry
		 * number:
		 * \n
		 *  Edddd
		 * \n
		 * i.e. the entry delimiter followed by some digits. Logsheet
		 * won't check for that condition, but any existing Logsheet
		 * that is re-opened for append may have an incorrect starting
		 * entry number.
