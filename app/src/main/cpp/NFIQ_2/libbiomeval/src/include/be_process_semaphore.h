		 * @brief
		 * Represent a semaphore that can be used for interprocess
		 * communication.
		 * @details
		 * Semaphores are shared counters with mutually exclusive 
		 * modification properties. A counter value greater than
		 * zero means that a resource represented by the semaphore
		 * is available. A typical use is to grant exclusive access
		 * to a resource by allowing the counter to be valued at zero
		 * or one; this is known as a binary semaphore.
		 * @note
		 * The counter value is not exposed to clients of the object.
		 * @note
		 * Because a Semaphore object wraps a system resource, the
		 * Semaphore can be passed to other functions, or inherited
		 * across a fork boundary.
